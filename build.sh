#   bash build.sh              setup -> unit tests -> release APK (R8, ~2.2 MB)
#   bash build.sh --debug      same but unshrunk (D8, ~5.4 MB) - the safe fallback

#   bash build.sh --quick      skip the unit tests
#   bash build.sh --both       build BOTH configurations into separate files
#
# --release (default) -> app/build/app.apk            R8-shrunk, 2.2 MB, API 19+ (one dex)
# --debug             -> app/build/app-debug.apk      unshrunk + debuggable, API 21+ (six)
# --both              -> app/build/app.apk + app/build/app-debug.apk

# The release build is the one that runs on Android 4.4: it is a single classes.dex, and
# Dalvik cannot load a second one without the multidex library. verify_apk.py enforces
# that invariant, so a release that grows past 64K methods fails the build here rather
# than on the phone.
#
# app/build/app.apk is ALWAYS the release build - the debug one never overwrites it - so
# the two files cannot be confused by a later publish.
#
# --publish implies --both, because the `apk` branch carries both APKs: the shrunk one
# for a normal download and the unobfuscated one for when something about the shrunk
# build is suspect. Both are signed with the same key, so either installs over the
# other (publish-apk.sh refuses to publish a pair that would not).
#
# The APK is verified in both configurations (verify_apk.py): R8 can delete code the
# framework reaches by name, and the release APK is the only artifact a phone ever
# sees, so the artifact itself is checked rather than trusted.
#
# No Gradle and no Android SDK: see toolchain/README.md. AndroidX (appcompat,
# Material 3, RecyclerView, ConstraintLayout) is fetched from a committed Gradle
# cache by toolchain/androidx.sh and linked automatically - see RECIPE.md §9.

API=34
# Android 4.4 (API 19) is the floor, and it is the interesting one: a 4.4 phone cannot
# capture its own screen (MediaProjection is API 21) and cannot be touched
# (dispatchGesture is API 24), but as the *guest* it needs nothing newer - so an old
# phone makes a first-class controller for a modern one. ApiLevels holds that policy.
MIN_API=19
# The debug configuration is dexed with a higher floor on purpose. R8 shrinks the
# release build into a single classes.dex, which Dalvik (API < 21) can load; the
# unshrunk debug build is ~6 dex files and Dalvik only ever loads the first one, so a
# debug APK claiming 19 would install and then die with NoClassDefFoundError. Native
# multidex starts at 21, so that is what it declares. (It is not a preference: D8
# refuses to emit the extra dex files below 21 without a main-dex list, because a
# min-api-19 build must fit in one dex. The release build is checked for exactly that.)

# for both configurations, which is what keeps them installable over each other.
# versionCode 4: versionCode 2's release build could not launch at all (R8 deleted the
# unlisted SplashActivity); versionCode 3's could not launch on Android 4.4 (aapt2
# gutted every vector's base copy, so AppCompat's pre-L vector probe died at startup).
