#
# Two APKs, one commit: the R8-shrunk release build (~2.2 MB) and the unobfuscated debug
# build (~5.4 MB). Whichever you grab, it is the same app - same package, same key, same
# versionCode - so either installs straight over the other. That is checked below, not
# assumed: a mismatched pair would fail with INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE on the
# phone, which is a bad place to find out.
#
# WHY A SEPARATE BRANCH
# ---------------------
# Both APKs together are ~7.6 MB and change on every build. Committing them to `main`
# would add new blobs to history on every push, so `git clone` would hand you every APK
# ever built, forever. Binary blobs do not delta-compress like source does, so that grows
# without bound.
#
# Instead the APKs live on their own branch, and every publish REPLACES that branch with
# a single parentless commit:
#
#     apk:  *  (these builds)        <- always exactly one commit, always two APKs
#     main: *---*---*---*---*        <- source history only, never a binary
#
# A fresh clone of `main` downloads source and nothing else; anyone who wants an APK
# clones/fetches `apk` and pays for exactly one copy of each.
#
# HOW IT WORKS WITHOUT SWITCHING BRANCHES
# ---------------------------------------
# git plumbing writes the commit object directly - no checkout, no working-tree changes,
# nothing to stash:
#   hash-object -w   store each APK as a blob
#   mktree           build a tree from "mode sha path" lines
#   commit-tree      make a commit with NO parent (that is what makes it orphan)
#   push --force     point the remote branch at it, discarding the previous one

Both are the same app - package \`$(pkg_name "$APK")\`, versionCode \`$(pkg_code "$APK")\`, signed
by the same key - **so either installs straight over the other**, in either order, keeping
your data. Two differences are worth knowing:

* R8 renames and inlines things on its way to the smaller file. That is the point of it.
* The debug build is unshrunk, so it carries whole libraries as separate dex files, and
  Dalvik (Android 4.4) only ever loads the first one. That is why it declares Android
  $(min_sdk "$DEBUG_APK") as its floor and the release build does not: the release build is a
  single dex file and runs on 4.4."

# GhostHand - build artifacts (generated, do not edit)

This branch exists only to hand out the APKs. It is **replaced on every publish** and
therefore always has exactly **one commit** and exactly **$APK_COUNT_WORD**.
That is on purpose: build output must never accumulate in the source history, or every
clone would drag along every APK ever built.

$APK_TABLE

## Install

\`\`\`bash
git fetch origin $BRANCH
$INSTALL_LIST

adb install -r GhostHand.apk        # or GhostHand-debug.apk - either order works
\`\`\`

Every build is signed with the same key (\`keystore/damjay_debug.keystore\`), so a new
APK installs straight over the previous one - no uninstalling, no lost settings.

## Which one do I want

* **Want it to be small, or you are shipping it:** \`$NAME\`.
* **Something is behaving oddly and you want to see:**
  \`$DEBUG_NAME\` - nothing is renamed or removed, so a stack trace points at real class
  names and the accessibility service, encoder and protocol classes are all present as
  written. It is the bigger download and it is slower, and it logs more.
* **Download of the big one failing:** take \`$NAME\`. Same app, same key, smaller file -
  and it is the one that runs on the oldest phones.
* **Android 4.4:** take \`$NAME\`. The debug build will refuse to install there
  (INSTALL_FAILED_OLDER_SDK) because it needs the platform's multi-dex loading.

## Build them yourself

\`\`\`bash
bash build.sh                                 # setup + AndroidX + 63 unit tests + release APK
