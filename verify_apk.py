"""verify_apk.py -- check that a built APK still contains what the app needs.

    python3 verify_apk.py [app/build/app.apk]

Why this exists
---------------
The release build is shrunk by R8, and R8's call graph starts from the code it can
see. Android is not in that graph: the classes it instantiates (activities, services,
the accessibility service) and the methods it calls (lifecycle callbacks, onClick,
onReceive) are only reachable if the keep rules say so.

Getting that wrong does not break the build. It produces a *smaller, valid, signed
APK* that crashes or silently does nothing on a real phone - which is exactly the
class of bug that cannot be caught here, because there is no device or emulator.

It is not hypothetical: `InjectionAccessibilityService` was reduced to two static
methods by R8 (its `onServiceConnected` was dead code to R8, so the static `instance`
field looked like it could never be set, so the `dispatchGesture` call was
unreachable, so the whole injection path was deleted) - and only in the release APK.
Everything compiled, signed and "verified" happily.

So the build checks the artifact instead of trusting it:

  * required **classes**      - is the class still in the dex at all, and under its
                                original name (the framework looks them up by name)
  * required **method names** - string-table check for the calls that must survive
                                (a renamed call to a library method would be a
                                NoSuchMethodError on the device)
  * required **resources**    - the accessibility config, which carries the
                                canPerformGestures flag the whole feature hinges on
  * the **dex count against the declared minSdk** - see below

There is a second trap of the same species, and it is about old devices rather than
shrinking. Before Android 5.0 the runtime loads exactly one dex file: classes.dex. An APK
that declares minSdk < 21 and ships classes2.dex will install happily and then die with
NoClassDefFoundError the first time it touches anything in the second file - no multidex
library, no warning, just a crash on the oldest device you own. So the count is compared
against the manifest's own minSdkVersion, which is read back out of the built binary
manifest with aapt2.

Exit code 0 = the APK is intact, 1 = something was shrunk away or cannot load on the
platform it claims to support, 2 = usage/IO error.

# Resources that have to survive the link step. These are compiled to binary XML, so

# compiled res XML stay ASCII. Both are tried, so the check cannot silently pass
# because of an encoding guess.
#
# Paths are globs because aapt2 auto-versions XML that uses a newer attribute: it splits
# res/xml/foo.xml into a base file and res/xml-v22/foo.xml, so a device that can honour
# the attribute loads the qualified copy and everyone else gets the plain one. That is
# correct behaviour and it is exactly what happened to the accessibility config when
# minSdk dropped to 19 - the base file no longer carries canPerformGestures, and the
# first version of this check called that a failure. Matching the whole family and
# requiring the symbol in *one* of them is the accurate question to ask.

# Note there is no "mediaProjection" here on purpose: aapt2 resolves that attribute
# value to its integer flag (0x20) during compilation, so the *string* is legitimately

# dex self-containment
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The bug this exists for: the first published APK called
# kotlin.jvm.internal.Intrinsics from AppCompatActivity's constructor and did not
# contain that class. R8 had said so - it warns about missing classes - but a
# `-dontwarn kotlin.**` in proguard.pro threw the warning away, the build stayed
# green, and the app died on launch with ClassNotFoundException on a real phone.
#
# R8 now fails on a missing class, and its exceptions are declared one by one in
# proguard.pro. But R8 only reports what it can reach; this check reads the finished
# dex and asks a blunter question: *every* type the APK references under a package
# that must ship inside it - androidx.*, com.google.*, kotlin.*, kotlinx.*,
# org.jetbrains.* and our own damjay.control.ghosthand.* - is it defined in the APK?
# If not, it has to be listed in packaging-allowlist.txt with a reason.
#
# Those are exactly the packages that are neither provided by the platform (android.*,
# java.*) nor optional-at-runtime by design - so a type from one of them that the dex
# names and the APK does not contain is a NoClassDefFoundError waiting for the code
# path that touches it.
